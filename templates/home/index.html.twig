            Abyss Protocol is a captivating sci-fi game that plunges players into a dark, gritty, and violent cyberpunk universe. Set in a dystopian future where humanity has spread across the stars, the game unfolds in a shadowy, high-tech metropolis on a distant planet. Here, advanced technology and rogue AI reign supreme, while the remnants of civilization struggle to survive amidst the decaying megastructures and neon-lit ruins. <br>
            This game seamlessly blends elements of horror and cyberpunk, immersing players in a world where nightmarish bio-mechanical creatures and corrupted machines lurk in every shadow. Players will navigate treacherous streets, uncover twisted secrets, and confront the terrifying entities that haunt this high-tech, low-life society.<br>
            Prepare to dive into a relentless battle for survival, where every decision could mean the difference between life and death. In Abyss Protocol, the future is bleak, the stakes are high, and the technology that once promised salvation has become a harbinger of doom.<br>
