            Abyss Protocol is a captivating sci-fi game that plunges players into a dark, gritty, and violent cyberpunk universe. Set in a dystopian future where humanity has spread across the stars, the game unfolds in a shadowy, high-tech metropolis on a distant planet. Here, advanced technology and rogue AI reign supreme, while the remnants of civilization struggle to survive amidst the decaying megastructures and neon-lit ruins. <br>
